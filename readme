CNN Model for Waste Management

A deep learning-based approach to classify waste into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Overview
This project aims to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify waste into different categories, such as recyclable, non-recyclable, organic, etc. The model is trained and tested on a dataset of images of various types of waste.

Features
- CNN model implemented using Keras and TensorFlow
- Dataset of images of different types of waste
- Training and testing scripts
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Keras 2.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
